# Inferior_Visual_Field_Testing_MDM


Inferior Visual Field Testing:
    In Pediatric Perimeter, the FIXATION LEDs will be at the center of the dome and the LED sweep will start from the open end of the LED strip to the center of the dome.  So the infant will be looking at the fixtion while performing the perimetry. Now to the test the inferior part of the vision (extending the inferior part), the FIXATION is moved a bit upwards i.e. it makes some angle with the center fixation. Now the fixation is on the 19th meridian and sweep will start from the 7th meridian, then into daisy till the fixation point on the 19th meridian.
